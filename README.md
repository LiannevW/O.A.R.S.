# O.A.R.S.

Group project for [Row Coaching](http://rowcoaching.com/). Building this react-redux app was part of the real-world projects of Codaisseur Academy. 

# Project summary 

With  OARS  the coach can monitor gps, speed and stroke information of a certain training. The data sends from a tablet device and will load automatically on the web app. The app is there to render and store the information of each training so the coach has an overview of the past trainings and, the improvements and changes in performances his pupils are making.
